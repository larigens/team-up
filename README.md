## Description

Team Up is a back-end application that generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each employee on a software engineering team. 

All you need to do is enter a few simple pieces of information, and this tool will generate a document that provides managers an easy way to navigate through his/her team's important information.

## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

Click `<> code` - the green button. After clicking, in the local tab, copy the SSH key. Open the terminal in your Macbook or [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), if you have Windows/Linux, and type:

```bash
git clone [paste ssh key]
```

I would recommend downloading [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to edit the code locally. If you need more information on how to clone a repository, [click here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)!

### Prerequisites

This package requires you to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), npm and Inquirer installed on your machine. You can install `npm` by running the code below on your terminal:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```
### Setting Up

Open the project in VS Code and make sure you are in the directory of this application before installing `Inquirer`. To install it, type the command below on your terminal:

```bash
npm install --save inquirer@^8.2.5
```

**Note: Be sure to download this version, because newer versions no longer use the commonjs syntax require('inquirer').**

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance:

## Usage

Launch the application by entering the command below on your terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

After launching the application, the user must answer a series of questions about each profile being built.

The user will be prompted to enter the **team manager's name**, **employee ID**, **email address** and **office number**. Then a menu with three options appears: Add engineer, an intern or finish building the team.

If another employee is being added, the user must enter the employee's **name**, **ID** and **email address**. If the engineer option is selected, the user will also be prompted to enter engineer's **GitHub username**. If the intern option is selected, the user will also be prompted to enter the intern's **school**. Then the user is taken back to the menu where he can add another employee (engineer or intern) or finish building the team.

## Tests

### Prerequisites

To test this application, you will need to install [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest).

```bash
npm i jest
```

Then, add Jest as a dev dependency to the project by running:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

### Running Tests

Open your terminal, make sure you are in the directory of this application and type the command below:

```bash
npx jest
```

You should see a result like the following:

<img src="./dist/assets/images/demo.png" alt="App Screenshot" width="700px" height="340px" />

All tests passed, and all four Test Suites ran without errors.
