## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

Click `<> code` - the green button. After clicking, in the local tab, copy the SSH key. Open the terminal in your Macbook or [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), if you have Windows/Linux, and type:

```bash
git clone [paste ssh key]
```

I would recommend downloading [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to edit the code locally. If you need more information on how to clone a repository, [click here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)!
### Prerequisites

This package requires you to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), npm and Inquirer installed on your machine. You can install `npm` by running the code below on your terminal:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```
### Setting Up

Open the project in VS Code and make sure you are in the directory of this application before installing `Inquirer`. To install it, type the command below on your terminal:

```bash
npm install --save inquirer@^8.0.0
```

**Note: Be sure to download this version, because newer versions no longer use the commonjs syntax require('inquirer').**

You will also need to install [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) to run the unit tests.

```bash
npm i jest
```

## Mock-Up

The following gif shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Usage

Launch the application by entering the command below on your terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

Once the application is launched, a series of questions will appear so that the user can enter the necessary information to build the profile.
